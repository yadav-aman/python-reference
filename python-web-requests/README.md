# Interacting with Web Apps and Services

In this module, we'll look into a bunch of different tools that can be really useful in today's IT world. You'll first learn how you can use different text formats to store data in text files, retrieve it, and even transmit it over the internet.

Later on, we'll look into how we can get our code to interact with services running on different computers using a module called Python Requests.

We'll see a bunch of different examples and give you pointers to more information. Don't forget that the best way to get comfortable with all these modules and libraries is to come up with your own examples and practice writing scripts on your local computer!

# Project Problem Statement

To complete this module, you'll write a script that interacts with a running web service.  The web service is part of your company's website and is in charge of storing and displaying the customer reviews of the company.

The reviews are stored in text files in the local disk. Your script should open those files, process the information to turn it into the format expected by the web service, then send it to the web service to get stored.

For this lab, the service is running on the same machine, and you can actually look at how all of it is implemented, if you want.  But you don't need to change the service implementation to complete the exercise.
